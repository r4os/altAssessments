Repository to crowd source how science should be assessed.

## Problem to be solved

At this moment, most people understand that the JIF is a very bad measure and must not
be used to assess research output or researchers. Of course, just talking to the researchers,
discuss their work, that's an important way to assess the work of that person or the person
itself. But for practical means, that's not always possible, and human communication itself
me not be a good measure of the quality of some research. So, are there indicators that
capture and reflect research quality?

What are indicators of quality science?

## Crowdsourcing

The European Commission has requested the community to develop new metrics and awarded
recently a research grant to develop an Open Science monitor.

But it is better of the scholarly community itself comes up with a detailed overview
of metrics to select from, an long list of research-backed indicators of which we know
what they capture and how they can be interpreted. And that may be different from one
research field to another.

Let's have a go at this!

## Outcome

The anticipated outcome will be this list of indicators that funders, research institutes,
tenure committees, etc, can use to communicate how they assess research and researchers.

That way, let's remove arbitrary decisions and replace this with transparent processes,
so that we can all focus on what we really want to do: do research itself.
